/** Obtains the current size of window. 

If window is not onscreen, it returns the size GTK+ will suggest to the window manager for the initial window size (but this is not reliably the same as the size the window manager will actually select). The size obtained by Window::Size() is the last size received in a EventConfigure, that is, GTK+ uses its locally-stored size, rather than querying the X server for the size. As a result, if you call Window::Resize() then immediately call Window::Size(), the size won't have taken effect yet. After the window manager processes the resize request, GTK+ receives notification that the size has changed via a configure event, and the size of the window gets updated.

Note 1: Nearly any use of this function creates a race condition, because the size of the window may change between the time that you get the size and the time that you perform some action assuming that size is the current size. To avoid race conditions, connect to "configure-event" on the window and adjust your size-dependent state to match the size delivered in the EventConfigure.

Note 2: The returned size does not include the size of the window manager decorations (aka the window frame or border). Those are not drawn by GTK+ and GTK+ has no reliable method of determining their size.

Note 3: If you are getting a window size in order to position the window onscreen, there may be a better way. The preferred way is to simply set the window's semantic type with Window::TypeHint(), which allows the window manager to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent of dialogs with Window::TransientFor() window managers will often center the dialog over its parent window. It's much preferred to let the window manager handle these things rather than doing it yourself, because all apps will behave consistently and according to user prefs if the window manager handles it. Also, the window manager can take the size of the window decorations/border into account, while your application cannot.

In any case, if you insist on application-specified window positioning, there's still a better way than doing it yourself - Window::Position(const Point &) or better Window::Position(OneOf<GtkWindowPosition, WindowPosition> ) will frequently handle the details for you.

This function returns the position you need to pass to Window::Position(const Point &) or Window::Position(int, int) to keep window in its current position. This means that the meaning of the returned value varies with window gravity. Window::Position(const Point &) for more details.

If you haven't changed the window gravity, its gravity will be GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that Window::Position() gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager frame for the window. Window::Position(const Point &) sets the position of this same top-left corner.

Window::Position() is not 100% reliable because the X Window System does not specify a way to obtain the geometry of the decorations placed on a window by the window manager. Thus GTK+ is using a "best guess" that works with most window managers.

Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken with respect to their handling of window gravity. So moving a window to its current position as returned by Window::Position() tends to result in moving the window slightly. Window managers are slowly getting better over time.

/** Asks the window manager to move window to the given position. 

Window managers are free to ignore this; most window managers ignore requests for initial window positions (instead using a user-defined placement algorithm) and honor requests after the window has already been shown.

Note: the position is the position of the gravity-determined reference point for the window. The gravity determines two things: first, the location of the reference point in root window coordinates; and second, which point on the window is positioned at the reference point.

By default the gravity is GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, so the reference point is simply the x, y supplied to Window::Position(const Point &) or Window::Position(int, int). The top-left corner of the window decorations (aka window frame or border) will be placed at the x, y specified by the Point or directly in the function call. Therefore, to position a window at the top left of the screen, you want to use the default gravity (which is GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST) and move the window to 0,0.

To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, you would set GDK_GRAVITY_SOUTH_EAST, which means that the reference point is at x + the window width and y + the window height, and the bottom-right corner of the window border will be placed at that reference point. So, to place a window in the bottom right corner you would first set gravity to south east, then write: window->Position(gdk_screen_width() - window_width, gdk_screen_height() - window_height) (note that this example does not take multi-head scenarios into account).

/** Create popup windows

Dialog boxes are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount of input, e.g. to display a message, ask a question, or anything else that does not require extensive effort on the user's part.

GTK+ treats a dialog as a window split vertically. The top section is a VBox, and is where widgets such as a Label or a Entry should be packed. The bottom area is known as the action_area. This is generally used for packing buttons into the dialog which may perform functions such as cancel, ok, or apply. The two areas are separated by a HSeparator.

Dialog boxes are created with a the relevant constructors, the constructor will allows you to set the dialog title, some convenient flags, and add simple buttons.

A 'modal' dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application from user input), can be created by calling Window::Modal() on the dialog. When creating a dialog you can also pass the DialogModal flag to make a dialog modal.

If you add buttons to Dialog through the constructor, using Dialog::AddButton(), or Dialog::AddButtons() clicking the button will emit a signal called "response" with a response ID that you specified. GTK+ will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are entirely user-defined. But for convenience, you can use the response IDs in the ResponseType enumeration (these all have values less than zero). If a dialog receives a delete event, the "response" signal will be emitted with a response ID of ResponseDeleteEvent.

If you want to block waiting for a dialog to return before returning control flow to your code, you can call Dialog::Run(). This function enters a recursive main loop and waits for the user to respond to the dialog, returning the response ID corresponding to the button the user clicked.

For the simple dialog in the following example, in reality you'd probably use GMessageDialog to save yourself some effort. But you'd need to create the dialog contents manually if you had more than a simple message in the dialog. 

\example
// Function to open a dialog box displaying the message provided. 

void quick_message (const char *message) {
   gtk::ButtonVec b;
   b.push_back(gtk::ButtonData(GTK_STOCK_OK, ResponseOk);

   gtk::Dialog dialog("Message", b);

   dialog.Body(gtk::Label(message));

   dialog.ShowAll();

   dialog.Run();

/** Blocks in a recursive main loop until the dialog either emits the "response" signal, or is destroyed.

If the dialog is destroyed during the call to Dialog::Run(), the function returns ResponseNone. Otherwise, it returns the response ID from the ::response signal emission.

Before entering the recursive main loop, Dialog::Run() calls Window::Show() on the dialog for you. Note that you still need to show any children of the dialog yourself.

During Dialog::Run(), the default behavior of "delete-event" is disabled; if the dialog receives ::delete_event, it will not be destroyed as windows usually are, and Dialog::Run() will return GTK_RESPONSE_DELETE_EVENT. Also, during Dialog::Run() the dialog will be modal. You can force Dialog::Run() to return at any time by calling Dialog::Response() to emit the ::response signal. Destroying the dialog during Dialog::Run() is a very bad idea, because your post-run code won't know whether the dialog was destroyed or not.

After Dialog::Run() returns, you are responsible for hiding or destroying the dialog if you wish to do so.

Typical usage of this function might be:

\example
  gint result = dialog.Run();
  switch (result) {
    case gtk::ResponseAccept:
         do_application_specific_something ();
         break;
    default:
         do_nothing_since_dialog_was_cancelled ();
         break;
  }
\endexample

Note that even though the recursive main loop gives the effect of a modal dialog (it prevents the user from interacting with other windows in the same window group while the dialog is run), callbacks such as timeouts, IO channel watches, DND drops, etc, will be triggered during a Dialog::Run() call.

/** A FileFilter can be used to restrict the files being shown in a FileChooser. 

Files can be filtered based on their name (FileFilter::AddPattern()), on their mime type (with FileFilter::AddMimeType()), or by a custom filter function (with FileFilter::AddCustom()).

Filtering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of text/plain. Note that FileFilter allows wildcards for the subtype of a mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image / *.

    /** File chooser interface used by FileChooserWidget and FileChooserDialog

FileChooser is an interface that can be implemented by file selection widgets. In GTK+, the main objects that implement this interface are FileChooserWidget, FileChooserDialog, and FileChooserButton. You do not need to write an object that implements the FileChooser interface unless you are trying to adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming interface.

FileChooser allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem. In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It may be a bit confusing at first taht these shortcuts come from various sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:

|Bookmarks|are created by the user, by dragging folders from the right pane to the left pane, or by using the "Add". Bookmarks can be renamed and deleted by the user.
|Shortcuts|can be provided by the application or by the underlying filesystem abstraction (e.g. both the gnome-vfs and the Windows filesystems provide "Desktop" shortcuts). Shortcuts cannot be modified by the user.
|Volumes|are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are the "roots" of the filesystem. 

!File Names and Encodings

When the user is finished selecting files in a FileChooser, your program can get the selected names either as filenames or as URIs. For URIs, the normal escaping rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters. However, filenames are always returned in the character set specified by the G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment variable. Please see the Glib documentation for more details about this variable. 
#IMPORTANT:# This means that while you can pass the result of FileChooser::Filename() to open(2) or fopen(3), you may not be able to directly set it as the text of a Label widget unless you convert it first to UTF-8, which all GTK+ widgets expect. You should use g_filename_to_utf8() to convert filenames into strings that can be passed to GTK+ widgets.

!Key Bindings

Internally, GTK+ implements a file chooser's graphical user interface with the private GtkFileChooserDefaultClass. This widget has several key bindings and their associated signals. This section describes the available key binding signals.

FileChooser key binding example

The default keys that activate the key-binding signals in GtkFileChooserDefaultClass are as follows:

||Signal name||Default key combinations
|location-popup|Control+L (empty path); / (path of "/")[a]; ~ (path of "~")
|up-folder|Alt+Up[b] ; Backspace
|down-folder|Alt+Down
|home-folder|Alt+Home
|desktop-folder|Alt+D
|quick-bookmark|Alt+1 through Alt+0

[a] Both the individual / key and the numeric keypad's "divide" key are supported.
[b] Both the individual Up key and the numeric keypad's Up key are supported.

You can change these defaults to something else. For example, to add a Shift modifier to a few of the default bindings, you can include the following fragment in your .gtkrc-2.0 file:

\example
binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings" {
	bind "<Alt><Shift>Up" {
		"up-folder" ()
	}
	bind "<Alt><Shift>Down" {
		"down-folder" ()
	}
	bind "<Alt><Shift>Home" {
		"home-folder" ()
	}
}

/** A file chooser dialog, suitable for "File/Open" or "File/Save" commands.

FileChooserDialog is a dialog box suitable for use with "File/Open" or "File/Save as" commands. This widget works by putting a FileChooserWidget inside a Dialog. It exposes the FileChooser interface, so you can use all of the FileChooser functions on the file chooser dialog as well as those for Dialog.

Note that FileChooserDialog does not have any methods of its own. Instead, you should use the functions that work on a FileChooser.

In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use GtkFileChooserDialog to select a file for opening.

\example

std::string open() {
    gtk::FileChooserDialog dlg("Open a file...");
    dlg.AddButton(GTK_STOCK_OK, ResponseOk);
    dlg.AddButton(GTK_STOCK_CANCEL, ResponseCancel);

    if (dlg.Run() == gtk::ResponseOk)
        return dlg.Filename();
